# My Development Environment

This repository contains my personal configuration files for various development tools.

## Tools

*   [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
*   [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
*   [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
*   [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

## Setup

The configuration files are intended to be placed in the user's home directory. For example, the `nvim` configuration would be at `~/.config/nvim` and the `tmux` configuration at `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`.

The scripts in `.local/scripts` can be added to your system's `PATH`.
